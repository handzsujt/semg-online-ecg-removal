# semg-online-ecg-removal

This package contains a python algorithm for online filtering an sEMG-signal using a stationary wavelet transform.
The class `sEMGOnlineFilter` in `sEMG_online_filter.py` can be used as an interface for using the online sEMG ECG removal algorithm in your own project.
An example how to do this is given in the file `sEMG_simulation_multichannel.py`. There you can see how to filter your data using the `sEMGOnlineFilter` class.
It is also shown, how to plot the raw and filtered signals fast. Therefore, a recorded respiratory sEMG with airway pressure measurement is used.

If you only want to use parts of the package, take a look in the given interface. There you can see how the individual methods can be used.

### Content
Python implementations of
- the online wavelet denoising algorithm (for single- and multichannel measurements)
- an online QRS detection
- online causal FIR and IIR filters
- a causal three-layer filter bank
- online calculation the envelope of a signal
- an interface to easily filter a real-time measurement
- a method to identify the best ECG for QRS detection out of multiple given signals
- an example of how to use the interface

### Run
In order to start the example, you have to run `main.py`.

If you just want to use the provided interface, you only have to create an `sEMGOnlineFilter` and call `filter_sEMG_online(..)` on the object.
This interface is also used in the given example.

### Requirements
The requirements can be installed with
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
.
